# movie-review-sentiment-analysis
Processing 50k records of labeled IMDB database for movie review text classification with Tfidf

Dataset: [Kaggle IMDB](https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews)

Processing initially includes stopwords, it turns out that some stopwords actually needed for a better understanding of a sentiment. In the code, I disable (#) the stopwords.
